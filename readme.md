## Generator
Chrome Extension generator that creates everything you need to get started with extension development. You can choose Browser UI(Browser,Page Action, Omnibox) type and select into permissions what you need.

If you need more information? Please visit [Google Chrome Extension Develpment](http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/devguide.html)

## Development
Go to: chrome://extensions, enable Developer mode and load app as an unpacked extension choosing the /app directory. If you desire to use SASS and/or Coffeescript when developing a `grunt watch` task is provided.

## Build & Package
By default, generators compress the file that was created by building a js/css/html/resource file. You can distribute the compressed file using the Chrome Developer Dashboard to publish to the Chrome Web Store.

Run this command to build your Chrome Extension project.

`grunt build` 

or 

`grunt build --with-sass` if `grunt watch` was used to pre-process your CSS.
